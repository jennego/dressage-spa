# Dressage Tests App - Single Page Application (SPA)

This is the React SPA version of the dressage test listing app. API is running on Ruby on Rails.

Don't forget your dressage test or learn the wrong one!

TO DO

ASAP

- contexts for slide menu
- do something about the css/grommet/styled variables - this colors

Roadmap

- refactor code to modern react ✔️
- redesign - in progress
- error handling
- arena pull out - svg for now
- right click context menu (open, open in new tab, open pdf, add to favs)
- switch for dark mode - done
- Auth via Api/OAuth
- secure api? Or leave as public API?
- user settings (theme mode, arena setting) - local storage unless user is logged in
- app tour / help
- move textual content to headless CMS
- offline mode (after when things are done)

Index page

- Filter by year, org, level, asc and dsc
- Results component (same page as index)
- figure out default view (search only or show full list of tests and search to filter?)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
